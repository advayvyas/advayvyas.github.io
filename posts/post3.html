        I'm at Emory right now and really enjoyng this sumemr research program! I like cooking for myself, the REU group of friends I've made, and of course
        the research that I've been doing. It's really interesting and my mentor Dr. Drum is super helpful! Writing this while sitting in the living room of my apartment,
        looking out at the trees and the nice view in front of me. Really enjoying life here!!! (also had a great Atlanta vacation earlier w/ family!). Good stuff. I played
        some Wikipedia Speedruns today during research and talked about the NBA, WNBA, Hunger Games, Harry Potter, the gym (in 1 hour), and politics!
