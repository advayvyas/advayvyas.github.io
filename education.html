            Hey! My name is Advay and I'm a Statistics and Data Science major at the University of Texas at Austin. My academic interests include
            <mark>statistical theory, machine learning, mathematical modeling, game theory, graph theory, and pure mathematics</mark>.
            <br><br>
            I also enjoy subjects like the <mark>stock market, economics, modern history, political science</mark>. 
            I'm always looking to learn new things and expand my horizons.
            <br><br>
            In my free time, I love to read novels, bike on a trail, play football & basketball, watch the Longhorns & Cowboys, and read 
            Wikipedia articles on anything from car engines to combinatorics.
