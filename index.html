            Hey! My name is Advay and I'm a Statistics and Data Science + Mathematics double major. I'm interested in statistical theory, 
            machine learning, game theory, and pure mathematics.
            <br><br>
            I also enjoy subjects like the stock market, economics, modern history, political science.
            <br><br>
            In my free time, I love to bike, play football/basketball, and read Wikipedia articles on anything from car engines to combinatorics.
