                Hey! My name is Advay and I'm a Statistics and Data Science freshman at the University of Texas at Austin. My academic interests include
                <mark>statistical theory, machine learning, mathematical modeling, game theory, graph theory, and pure mathematics</mark>.
                <br><br>
                I also enjoy subjects like the <mark>stock market, economics, modern history, and political science</mark>. 
                I'm always looking to learn new things and expand my horizons!
                <br><br>
                In my free time, I love to read novels, bike, play football & basketball, watch the Texas Longhorns & Dallas Cowboys, and browse 
                Wikipedia articles!
